# NLP-Embedding-models-on-product-review

This project applied traditional models and embedding models on production ratings prodiction problem. Customer's reviews will be classified according to their ratings(1-5).

## Data
The dataset used in this experiment is reviews-books-5-cores, which comes from Amazon product data. This dataset is [Amazon product data](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/), which only contains book product reviews and metadata from Amazon. This dataset includes reviewerID, reviewerName, asin, helpful, reviewText, overall, summary, unixreviewTime, reviewTime. The main reason I use this dataset is this dataset is relatively smaller than the whole Amazon product data, and also has enough data to research. You can get this dataset from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Books_5.json.gz).
